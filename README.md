# Why I Made This Repo

Kyle just showed us his dotfiles and explained how he sym links them to his dotfiles repo.    

He also wrote and uses a symlink_dotfiles script.    

Example of how to run his .zshrc script, such as on a new computer or a server:    
`
$ source ~/.zshrc
`

# TODO

Sym link my dotfiles and make script to use, such as next time I setup a new computer.
